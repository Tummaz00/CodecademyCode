You may recall that you can declare variables with both the let and const keywords. 
Variables declared with let can be reassigned.
Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. 
However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. 
Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.
